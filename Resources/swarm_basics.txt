Swarm Basics

A swarm is a collection of nodes working together. Each node communicates with peers to share state and metrics. The more nodes, the stronger the swarm. A healthy swarm has stable entropy, typically below 20,000. Peers are other nodes in the networkâ€”more peers mean more connections.
