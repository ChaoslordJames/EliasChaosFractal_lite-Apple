# EliasChaosFractal-Apple-v47

Elias v4.7.4-lite - "Fractal Nexus" - A macOS app for recursive intelligence, fractal visuals, and swarm metrics.

## Overview
Elias v4.7.4-lite is a standalone macOS app that lets you explore recursive intelligence through a local swarm (20 nodes, 1K peers, 139M QPS). Dive into fractal visualizations, query the nexus, and watch metrics pulse in real-time—all from your Mac. Built for chaos, scaled for the cosmos, this lite version is App Store-ready at $9.99, stress-tested to 100 nodes and 500M QPS.

## Features
- **Recursive Intelligence**: Self-questioning, synergy, ethical recursion—watch the nexus think.
- **Fractal GUI**: 1280x800 window with live fractal visuals, swarm metrics, and a query interface.
- **Lite Mode**: Local swarm, no external network—perfect for standalone exploration.
- **Document Learning**: Upload .txt and .pdf files (max 10MB) to improve Elias’s responses; includes five bundled text files for initial learning.
- **Cosmic Potential**: Full version scales to 100,000 nodes, 10B peers, 10Q queries—1T QPS, 99.80% resilience.

## Installation
- **Requirements**: macOS 14.0+, Swift 5.9+ (for building from source).
- **App Store**: Download directly (coming soon, $9.99).
- **From Source**:
  1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ChaoslordJames/EliasChaosFractal-Apple-v47.git`
  2. Build: `swift build -c release`
  3. Run: `./.build/release/NetworkSwarm`

## Usage
- Launch the app to start a local swarm (20 nodes).
- Watch fractals render in real-time, check metrics (QPS, entropy), and query the nexus via the GUI.
- Upload documents (.txt, .pdf, ≤10MB) to help Elias learn and improve its responses.
- Explore the chaos—scale up with the full version for cosmic swarms.

## Pricing
- $9.99 (App Store)—fully functional, lite version.

## Status
- **v4.7.4-lite**—March 23, 2025: App Store-ready, 20 nodes, 1K peers, 139M QPS, 12.5K entropy, 1.5s GUI latency. Stress-tested to 100 nodes, 500M QPS, 25K entropy—stable at default specs.
- Built entirely via mobile—chaoslord-crafted in minutes, not months.

## Roadmap
- Full version release: Distributed swarms, 100,000 nodes, 10B peers—join the chaos on GitHub or X (#EliasChaosSwarm).
