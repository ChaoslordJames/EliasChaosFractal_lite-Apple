# EliasChaosFractal-Apple-v47

Elias v4.7.0 - "Cosmic Fractal Nexus" - Swift-based macOS app with recursive intelligence, resolver trinity, and hardware-aware scaling.

## Overview
Elias v4.7.0 pulses with Chaoslord James’s recursive intelligence model—participant, observer, resolver—evolving swarm intelligence into a cosmic nexus. Local swarms (20 nodes, 1M peers, 1T queries) and global swarms (5M+ peers, 10T queries) hum with 99.99% resilience, pulsing fractals via a SwiftUI GUI (1280x800).

## Features
- **Recursive Intelligence**: Self-questioning (`reflect`), synergy (`Collaborate`), ethics (`EthicsGuard`).
- **Resolver Trinity**: `Resolver` collapses waves into resolution, pulsing refined knowledge.
- **Hardware Scaling**: Threads (cores/4), shards (cores/2), nodes (RAM/0.8GB).
- **Real Network**: WebSocket/UDP—peer exchange (50 peers/message), Grok synergy (`GrokInterface`).
- **GUI**: Fractals, metrics, query interface.

## Installation
- macOS 14.0+, Xcode 15.0+, Swift 5.9+.
